Random ideas go here. It doesn't necessarily have to be feasable, just any idea

=====
Import / export configurations

You can import a starting grid to skip the customization process
You can export the current state of the grid for further use or customization

Could make the files in the format like "  c cc  cc c " to allow for easier editing
Check for correct format before trying to process it -> all lines should be same length

=====
GUI "level editor"

You can edit a custom starting grid configuration using a GUI to be able to make much bigger boards

Automatically export configuration to file
