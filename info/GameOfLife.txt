Game of Life
In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of the population relatively unpredictable. Conway's genetic laws are delightfully simple. First note that each cell of the checkerboard (assumed to be an infinite plane) has eight neighboring cells, four adjacent orthogonally, four adjacent diagonally. The rules are:

    1. Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighboring counters survives for the next generation.
    2. Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies (is removed) from overpopulation. Every counter with one neighbor or none dies from isolation.
    3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors — no more, no fewer — is a birth cell. Counter is placed on it at the next move.


Variations (once every 5 rounds):
    The player can delete or kill counters
    The player can give tags and colours to special counters and track how many generations they survive
    The player can start pandemics and define the chance of spreading / killing counters



Notes / Tipps:
    Use colorama module for coloured counters (for tracking purposes)
